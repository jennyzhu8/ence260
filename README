Welcome to MAZERUNNER!

The game has three difficulty levels: easy 'E', medium 'M', and hard 'H'. These determine the starting maze speed at the beginning of the game. To scroll through the level options, use the navigation switch. Choose the desired level by pressing down on the switch and the game will start.

Use the nav switch to move in any direction (up, down, left, right) around the screen to avoid the maze walls. The movement wraps around the screen horizontally (when held so that the nav switch is to the right of the LED screen) so the player can move to the far right from the far left by moving left once. Contrastingly, the vertical ends of the screen do not behave the same way and instead act as barriers to the player.

If the player hits a wall, the wall will keep pushing the player back until they either move away from it or are pushed off screen. If the player is pushed off screen, the game ends. As you play, the maze gradually speeds up until it reaches a set max speed depending on the chosen level.

Once the game is over, you can return to the main menu by pressing the button.

Good luck and have fun!
